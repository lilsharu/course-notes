As transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant.

This is saying that, when given a certain *area* of microchip, the power consumed in that same area remained roughly the same as the number of processors on the chip increased.

**However, in the Mid-2000s, this trend ended.** This is because of Quantum Leaping, which leads to power leaking and excess power consumption.
