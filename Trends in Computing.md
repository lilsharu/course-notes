## Moore's Law

The number of transistors on a single microchip doubles every two years.

This is usually accomplished by making transistors smaller. However, we have already reached a point where transistors are sized at the scale of atoms. Clearly, a single transistor can not be smaller than an atom, so there will come a point soon where we physically can't make transistors any smaller.

## Dennard Scaling

As transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant.

This is saying that, when given a certain *area* of microchip, the power consumed in that same area remained roughly the same as the number of processors on the chip increased.

**However, in the Mid-2000s, this trend ended.** This is because of Quantum Leaping, which leads to power leaking and excess power consumption.
