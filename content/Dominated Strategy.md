This is related to the idea of a [[Dominant Strategy]].

## Strictly Dominated Strategies

> [!summary] Definition: Strictly Dominated Strategy
> 
> A strategy $a_i \in A_i$ is **strictly dominated** by $a'_i \in A_i$ if
> 
> $$ u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) < u_i(a'_i, a_{-i}) \,\forall a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$$
> 
> In other words, no matter what actions other players take, the outcome / payoff of taking $a'_i$ is always better (and not equal to) taking $a_i$

Note that this can also generalize to any strategy $s_i$, not just action $a_i$.

With this property, you can use the following process: Iterated Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies:

Assuming that every player acts [[Rationality (Game Theory)|rationally]], for any player, if any action they take is strictly dominated by another action or strategy, we can simply "eliminate" that action altogetherâ€”as there is no reason that the player would choose that action since they have a strictly better strategy. This simplifies our game.

## Weakly Dominated Strategies

> $$ u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) \leq u_i(a'_i, a_{-i}) \,\forall a_{-i} \in A_{-i}$$ and
> $$ u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) < u_i(a'_i, a_{-i}) \text{ for some } a_{-i} \in A_{-i} $$
> 
> In other words, no matter what actions other players take, the outcome / payoff of taking $a'_i$ is the same or better than taking $a_i$, but is better in at least one scenario (they do not have exactly equal payoffs).
