> Suppose $V, \langle , \rangle)$ is a finite dimensional inner product space and $A \subseteq V$. A point $\vec v \in V$ is called a *limit point of $A$* provided that for all $\delta > 0$ we have that $B_\delta(\vec v)$ contains an element of $A$ other than $\vec v$, that is $A \cap (B_\delta(\vec v) \setminus \{\vec v\}) \neq \emptyset$.
