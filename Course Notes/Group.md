> [!info] **Definition: Group**
> A group $G$ is a set equipped with a binary operation $$(a, b) \mapsto a \cdot b$$ satisfying the following properties:
> 
> - Associativity: $a, b, c\quad (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
> - Identity: $\exists e \in G \text{ s.t. } a \cdot e = a = e \cdot a$
> - Inverse: Given $a \in G$, $\exists b \in G \text{ s.t. } a \cdot b = e = b \cdot a$

## Order

> [!info] **Definition: Order**
> The order of a group, denoted $\left| G\right|$, is the cardinality of $G$

> [!info] **Definition: Order (element)**
> If $a \in G$, then the order of $a$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$. This is equivalent to the order of the [[Subgroup]] generated by $a$.
