Also Known As *Soluble.*

> [!info] **Definition: Solvable Group**
> 
> A group $G$ is said to be solvable if it admits a [[Normal Series|normal series]] in which each subquotient $G_{i + 1}/G_i$ is [[Abelian Group|abelian]].

Remark: all [[Abelian Group|Abelian Groups]] are solvable.

> [!info] **Equivalent Definition (Finite Group)**
> 
> A finite group $G$ is said to be solvable if and only if the [[Composition Series|composition factors]] are all $C_p$ (finite cyclic groups of a prime order).
