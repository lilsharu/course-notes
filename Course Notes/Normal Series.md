> [!info] **Definition: Ascending Chain of Subgroups**
> 
> Let $G$ be an arbitrary group. An **ascending chain of subgroups** is a chain of subgroups as follows: $$ (e) = G_0 \lt G_1 \lt \cdots \lt G_k = G, $$
> where each subgroup is a _strict_ subgroup of the previous one. This is also called a **subgroup series**.

This then leads to the following definition of a **Normal Series:**

> [!info] **Definition: Normal Series**
> 
> Let $G$ be an arbitrary group. A **normal series** of $G$ is an ascending chain of subgroups $$ (e) = G_0 \triangleleft G_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft G_k = G, $$
> 
> Where each group $G_i$ is a normal subgroup of $G_{i + 1}$.

A **normal series** is also known as a **subnormal series.**
