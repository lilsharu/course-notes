> [!summary] **The Third Isomorphism Theorem**
> 
> Let $G$ be a group and $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.
> 
> 1. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between subgroups of $G/N$ and subgroups of $G$ containing $N$. The correspondence matches a subgroup $K$ of $G$ containing $N$ with a subgroup $K/N$ of $G/N$.
> 2. This correspondence preserves normality: the normal subgroups of $G/N$ correspond to the normal subgroups of $G$ containing $N$. That is, the subgroup $K$ of $G$ containing $N$ is normal in $G$ if and only if $K/N$ is normal in $G/N$.
> 3. The correspondence preserves quotients: if $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ containing $N$, then $$ (G/N)/(K/N) \simeq G/K $$
