> [!abstract] **Theorem: Lagrange's Theorem**
> Let $G$ be a finite group. Let $H \subseteq G$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $\left| H \right|$ divides $\left| G \right|$.
> 
> **Proof**:
> 
> We can prove this using [[Cosets#Left Cosets|Left Cosets]]
> 
> Because all left cosets of $H$ have the same order, and $G$ is the disjoint union of all left cosets of $H$ as below: $$G = \bigsqcup_{a \in G}aH,$$ we can say that $$\left|G\right| = \left|H\right| \cdot \left(\text{number of disjoint left cosets}\right),$$, which is also denoted $$\left|G\right| = \left|H\right| \cdot \left[G : H\right],$$


> [!note] **Corollary**
> Let $a \in G$. Then $o(a)$ divides $\left| G\right|$.
