The number of transistors on a single microchip doubles every two years.

This is usually accomplished by making transistors smaller. However, we have already reached a point where transistors are sized at the scale of atoms. Clearly, a single transistor can not be smaller than an atom, so there will come a point soon where we physically can't make transistors any smaller.
