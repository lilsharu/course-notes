At it's core, it attempts to answer the question: Given an algorithm and input size $n$, how many steps are needed?

The major metrics that are used are:
- Best Case
- Worst Case
- Average Case

Notation and Terminology:
- $n$: Input Size
- $f(n)$: Maximum number of steps taken by an algorithm when input has size $n$
- $O(f(n))$: Complexity class of $f(n)$. ([[Big-O Notation]])
