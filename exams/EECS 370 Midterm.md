## Topics Covered

I'm going to be very honest, I have no idea what's actually going to be on this exam (specifically, how much of data hazards / control hazards and beyond are going to be on the exam). But here's my best guess:
- [[Trends in Computing]]
	- [[Moore's Law]]
	- [[Dennard Scaling]]
- [[Assembly]]:
	- [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]]
	- [[LC2K]]
	- [[LEGv8]]
- Representing Data:
	- [[Number Bases|Binary, Hex, Octal, Decimal]]
	- [[Two's Complement Numbers]]
	- [[Floating Point Numbers]]
	- [[Biased Numbers (Floating Point Exponents)]]
	- [[Endianness]]
- Assembling LC2K into Machine Code
- C to Assembly (Specifically [[LEGv8]])
- [[LEGv8#Aligning Structs|Struct Alignment]]
- Function Calls
	- [[Caller Save vs Callee Save]]
	- Assigning Variables to Memory Locations
- [[Object Files]]
	- [[Object Files#Symbol Table|Symbol Table]]
	- [[Object Files#Relocation Table|Relocation Table]]
- Combinational Logic
	- [[Logic Gates]]
	- [[Muxes]]
	- [[Decoders]]
	- [[Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU)]]
	- [[Propagation Delay]]
- Sequential Logic
	- [[SR Latch]]
	- [[D Latch]]
	- [[D Flip-Flop]]
