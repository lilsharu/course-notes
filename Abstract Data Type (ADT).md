An abstract data type (ADT) combines data with valid operations and their behaviors on stored data.

Think of an ADT Like a "black box" with a bunch of buttons. Each button does an action (e.g. "delete," "insert," etc) but the implementation details about how that action is done "under-the-hood" isn't explained. It's an **interface** that describes what something needs to do, but doesn't describe how it is supposed to do it.

On the other hand, a [[Data Structure]] is the implementation of an Abstract Data Type.
